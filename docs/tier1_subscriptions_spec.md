# Tier 1 Subscriptions and Teams Functional Specification

## Overview
Tier 1 subscriptions introduce paid experiences for individual professionals and collaborative teams. This index provides a high-level overview of the functional areas and links to detailed specifications for each domain.

### Core Documents
- [Entitlements & Plans](tier1/entitlements_and_plans.md): plan catalog, entitlement payloads, caching, and delivery to clients.
- [Billing Flows](tier1/billing_flows.md): checkout, customer portal, webhook processing, invoices, and payment failure handling.
- [Organizations & Memberships](tier1/organizations_and_memberships.md): organization entity model, roles, membership lifecycle, seat accounting, and audit logging.
- [Feature Gating](tier1/feature_gating.md): enforcement surfaces, API validation, monitoring, and testing strategy.
- [Policy, Compliance & Security](tier1/policy_compliance_security.md): privacy, cancellation policies, grace periods, legal disclosures, and security controls.

## High-Level Goals
- Ensure paid entitlements propagate reliably within a single request cycle after billing confirmation.
- Maintain accurate seat synchronization between billing provider data and internal organization rosters.
- Provide transparent billing experiences with self-service management and detailed audit trails.
- Enforce premium gating consistently across server and client surfaces, backed by monitoring.
- Uphold privacy, compliance, and security obligations for all paid experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria Summary
- Plan changes and membership updates update entitlements immediately after webhook acknowledgement.
- Paid features remain locked until payment confirmation is received and processed.
- Removing a team member revokes access, updates seat counts, and records an auditable event.
- Gated APIs respond with clear entitlement errors when accessed without required permissions.
- Billing, privacy, and cancellation policies are documented and enforced across the product experience.
