# Tier 1 Policy, Compliance & Security Specification

## Privacy
- Paid features must operate without third-party tracking scripts; analytics limited to first-party tools.
- Data processing agreements updated to reflect paid feature usage and retention expectations.
- Provide granular privacy controls for Team admins to manage data residency preferences where supported.

## Refunds & Cancellations
- Publish refund policy outlining eligibility (e.g., prorated refunds within 14 days for annual plans, no refunds for monthly).
- Cancellations initiated via portal schedule subscription to end-of-term by default; immediate cancellation requires support intervention.
- Upon cancellation, system maintains access until period end, then downgrades entitlements and sends confirmation email.
- Maintain audit trail of cancellation reason codes for product feedback.

## Grace Period Enforcement
- Entitlements engine tracks grace period start/end dates sourced from billing events.
- UI indicates time remaining and consequences of non-payment.
- When grace period expires, trigger downgrade workflow and notify affected members.

## Security & Compliance
- Payment card data handled solely by billing provider; platform stores only tokenized references.
- Webhooks validated with shared secret and optional mTLS to prevent spoofing.
- Access controls enforced on billing admin tools with mandatory MFA for owners/admins.
- Conduct quarterly security review of subscription code paths, including entitlement token signing keys.

## Data Retention & Portability
- Paid account data retained per organization policy flags; minimum 30 days post-cancellation before deletion.
- Provide data export mechanisms (JSON/CSV) accessible during active subscription and for 30 days after downgrade.
- Backup copies of paid data are encrypted at rest and deleted according to retention schedule.

## Legal Disclosures
- Terms of Service updated to define subscription offerings, billing commitments, and seat responsibilities.
- Present localized tax and VAT information on checkout and invoices where applicable.
- Capture acceptance of updated terms when upgrading to paid plans.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Privacy controls and disclosures are documented in user-facing help center articles before launch.
2. Cancellation workflows consistently send confirmation communications and record reason codes.
3. Webhook endpoints reject unsigned or improperly signed requests and log the attempt for security review.
4. Data exports remain accessible for the promised retention window after cancellation without requiring support intervention.
