# Tier 1 Policy, Compliance & Security Specification

## Overview
This specification captures the foundational work required to launch Tier 1 monetization features while meeting policy, compliance, and security obligations. It consolidates legal requirements, operational expectations, and engineering deliverables so that product, security, and support teams can plan implementation work in parallel.

## Goals
- Provide a single source of truth for privacy, compliance, and security expectations tied to Tier 1 paid experiences.
- Translate policy statements into actionable engineering tasks and success criteria.
- Enumerate operational guardrails (logging, audit, communications) required ahead of launch approvals.

## Non-Goals
- Defining price points, SKU packaging, or marketing campaigns (covered in billing spec).
- Detailing customer support macros beyond the critical refund/cancellation flows outlined here.
- Documenting infrastructure hardening unrelated to subscription management.

## Stakeholders
- **Product**: Owns feature behavior, cancellation UX, and comms cadence.
- **Security & Compliance**: Validates controls, manages audits, and maintains evidence collection.
- **Legal**: Authors ToS updates, data processing agreements, and taxation disclosures.
- **Support & Operations**: Executes cancellation requests, tracks refund reasons, and ensures SLAs.
- **Finance**: Reconciles refunds, deferred revenue, and tax remittances.

## Scope
1. All Tier 1 paid features surfaced in the web application and associated APIs.
2. Billing integrations (payment processor, invoicing, webhooks).
3. Data export utilities that include paid feature artifacts.
4. Administrative tooling used by Owners/Admins to manage subscriptions.

## Architecture & Integration Outline
- **Services involved**: Billing service, entitlements service, email notification service, audit logging pipeline, and analytics warehouse (first-party only).
- **Data contracts**:
  - Billing events emit `grace_period_start`, `grace_period_end`, `cancellation_reason`, and `refund_amount` fields consumed by entitlements and audit logs.
  - Entitlements service exposes read-only API for privacy controls and data export status.
- **Authentication & authorization**:
  - Admin endpoints require MFA-backed sessions with role checks (`owner`, `billing-admin`).
  - Webhooks from the payment provider are validated with shared secrets and optional mTLS certificates rotated every 90 days.
- **Observability**: Structured logs for webhook validations, cancellation requests, and export downloads forwarded to SIEM with retention of 1 year.

## Policy Requirements
### Privacy
- Paid features must operate without third-party tracking scripts; analytics limited to first-party tools.
- Data processing agreements updated to reflect paid feature usage and retention expectations.
- Provide granular privacy controls for Team admins to manage data residency preferences where supported.
- **Engineering Tasks**
  - Add privacy toggle surface to admin console with API endpoint and audit logging.
  - Remove/disable third-party analytics for paid routes; add regression test to ensure absence.
- **Evidence**
  - Document privacy control screenshots and API specs for compliance review.

### Refunds & Cancellations
- Publish refund policy outlining eligibility (e.g., prorated refunds within 14 days for annual plans, no refunds for monthly).
- Cancellations initiated via portal schedule subscription to end-of-term by default; immediate cancellation requires support intervention.
- Upon cancellation, system maintains access until period end, then downgrades entitlements and sends confirmation email.
- Maintain audit trail of cancellation reason codes for product feedback.
- **Engineering Tasks**
  - Extend cancellation flow to collect reason code and customer confirmation.
  - Trigger entitlements downgrade job at `grace_period_end`; log completion status.
  - Ensure refund processing writes to finance ledger and generates customer email via notifications service.
- **Support Tasks**
  - Update help-center macro referencing refund policy and escalation path for immediate cancellations.

### Grace Period Enforcement
- Entitlements engine tracks grace period start/end dates sourced from billing events.
- UI indicates time remaining and consequences of non-payment.
- When grace period expires, trigger downgrade workflow and notify affected members.
- **Implementation Notes**
  - Add cron-based worker that scans for expired grace periods every hour and calls entitlements downgrade.
  - Introduce banner component displaying countdown timer sourced from entitlements API.
  - Instrument metrics `grace_period_entered_total` and `grace_period_expired_total` for monitoring.

### Security & Compliance
- Payment card data handled solely by billing provider; platform stores only tokenized references.
- Webhooks validated with shared secret and optional mTLS to prevent spoofing.
- Access controls enforced on billing admin tools with mandatory MFA for owners/admins.
- Conduct quarterly security review of subscription code paths, including entitlement token signing keys.
- **Security Controls**
  - Infrastructure-as-code updates ensuring PCI scope isolation for billing services.
  - Add automated webhook verification test as part of CI.
  - Schedule quarterly review with security checklist stored in compliance evidence repo.

### Data Retention & Portability
- Paid account data retained per organization policy flags; minimum 30 days post-cancellation before deletion.
- Provide data export mechanisms (JSON/CSV) accessible during active subscription and for 30 days after downgrade.
- Backup copies of paid data are encrypted at rest and deleted according to retention schedule.
- **Tasks**
  - Extend data export job to include paid feature content; expose status in admin console.
  - Implement lifecycle policy enforcing deletion once retention window closes, with audit log entry.
  - Ensure backup encryption keys rotate at least annually and are tracked by security team.

### Legal Disclosures
- Terms of Service updated to define subscription offerings, billing commitments, and seat responsibilities.
- Present localized tax and VAT information on checkout and invoices where applicable.
- Capture acceptance of updated terms when upgrading to paid plans.
- **Coordination**
  - Legal to deliver ToS redlines one sprint prior to beta launch.
  - Frontend adds modal capturing ToS acceptance with event logged to compliance database.
  - Finance validates tax engine configuration for target regions.

## Operational Readiness
- **Logging & Audit**: Centralize cancellation, refund, and export actions with user IDs and timestamps. Retain logs for minimum 1 year.
- **Incident Response**: Add Tier 1 monetization scenarios to incident runbooks (failed webhook validation, grace period overrun, export breach).
- **Support Playbooks**: Draft escalation steps for immediate cancellation, refund denial appeals, and data export troubleshooting.
- **Compliance Evidence**: Store quarterly security review notes, ToS acceptance rates, and privacy control screenshots in the compliance repository.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Sprint 1 – Foundations**
   - Implement webhook signature verification middleware and associated tests.
   - Create admin MFA enforcement check and upgrade migration scripts.
   - Draft refund policy content with legal review.
2. **Sprint 2 – Customer Flows**
   - Release cancellation flow updates (reason codes, confirmation emails, entitlements job).
   - Ship privacy control toggles and remove third-party analytics.
   - Add grace period UI banner and backend countdown support.
3. **Sprint 3 – Data Portability & Evidence**
   - Expand export tooling and retention lifecycle automation.
   - Integrate ToS acceptance modal with compliance logging.
   - Capture security/compliance evidence and finalize runbooks.

## Testing & Validation Strategy
- Automated integration tests covering webhook validation failure paths, cancellation emails, and entitlements downgrade.
- Manual QA checklist ensuring privacy controls persist, exports remain available post-cancellation, and tax disclosures display correctly.
- Security review sign-off required before GA release.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Privacy controls and disclosures are documented in user-facing help center articles before launch.
2. Cancellation workflows consistently send confirmation communications and record reason codes.
3. Webhook endpoints reject unsigned or improperly signed requests and log the attempt for security review.
4. Data exports remain accessible for the promised retention window after cancellation without requiring support intervention.
5. Compliance evidence (ToS acceptance logs, security review checklist, refund policy) is stored and discoverable ahead of launch review.

## Open Questions
- Do we need regional data residency support beyond EU and US for the initial launch?
- Should we offer partial refunds for multi-seat downgrades mid-cycle, and how would that integrate with finance ledgers?
- What SLA is required for generating data exports during high-volume periods?
